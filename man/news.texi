@section 0.2

@itemize @bullet

@item The variables @code{error-mode} and @code{interrupt-mode} control
where errors and user-interrupts (i.e. @code{SIGINT} signals) are
handled. The three possible values are: @code{top-level}, @code{exit}
and @code{nil} (denotes the current event loop).

@item Fixed bug where all dynamic types were erroneously @code{symbolp}.

@item @code{SIGINT}, @code{SIGHUP} and @code{SIGTERM} signals should
now be caught more successfully.

@item Added a new directory to @code{dl-load-path}:
@samp{@var{libexecdir}/rep/@var{arch}} to contain third-party shared
libraries.
