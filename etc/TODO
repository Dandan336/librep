Outstanding bugs
================

 ! Putting a breakpoint in a .jaderc file doesn't work correctly; the
   debugger is entered, but the commands don't work

 ! non-local file handles aren't finalised correctly when they're
   garbage collected, they're simply deallocated without calling
   close-file on them (this could be construed a ``feature'' rather
   than a bug?)

 ! It's relatively easy to blow the stack when regexp matching. Try
   searching for `/\*(.|\n)*\*/' in a C file with reasonable large
   comments.

 ! If a compiled file FOO.jlc is made from source file FOO, but FOO is
   newer, load doesn't notice, and loads the invalid FOO.jlc

 ! Reenable dumped Lisp files


General programming tasks:
==========================

 + Test defsubst declared functions when dumped

 - In the Lisp VM replace the `bindstack' list with a vector. Means
   that the compiler will need to track the binding depth as well as
   the stack depth.

 - Use two passes for `concat'; the first pass calculates the new
   string's length, the second builds it

 - Add more backends for accessing remote files

   Make remote-rcp work properly, and add others (ssh, http, ..?)

 - Make the compiler optimise its output

 - Make the LISP lexically scoped


Manual tasks:
=============

 + Document the internals (i.e. the C interface)
