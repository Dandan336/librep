This is librep, an Emacs Lisp-like runtime library for UNIX. It
contains a LISP interpreter, byte-code compiler and virtual machine.
Applications may use the LISP interpreter as an extension language, or
it may be used for standalone scripts.

It is known to compile on at least Solaris/sparc and Linux/ix86; it is
released under the terms of the GNU GPL, copyright John Harper
<john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

For more details see:

	http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~john/sw/librep.html

To compile this you'll need GNU make and (currently) GCC. Basically,
just do `./configure ; make ; make install'. If you're building from
the CVS sources, execute `aclocal ; autoconf' first.


Notes
=====

If you're on a 64-bit architecture you may want to look at the
`--with-value-type' and `--with-value-bits' configure options. For
example on a machine with 64-bit pointers and longs, but only 32-bit
ints the following could be done:

	$ ./configure --with-value-type=long --with-value-bits=64

Alternatively, if both int and long are 32-bits, with 64-bit pointers
and long long ints, then:

	$ ./configure --with-value-type="long long" --with-value-bits=64

If either of these options are set incorrectly a run-time assertion
will be triggered when the interpreter is initialised.
