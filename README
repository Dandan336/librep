[ this is -*-Text-*- ]

This is librep 0.0, an Emacs Lisp-like runtime library for UNIX. It
contains a LISP interpreter, byte-code compiler and virtual machine.
Applications may use the LISP interpreter as an extension language,
or it may be used for standalone scripts.

It is known to compile on at least Solaris/sparc and Linux/ix86; it is
released under the terms of the GNU GPL, copyright John Harper

This is a snapshot of the CVS repository:

	http://sprite.dcs.warwick.ac.uk:8080/cgi-bin/cvsweb

but should be pretty stable.

To compile this snapshot you'll need GNU Autoconf, GNU Libtool, GNU make,
and (currently) GCC. Run aclocal and autoconf in the root of the
distribution to create a configure script, then compile as normal
(generic instructions in the INSTALL file).

Please send any success or failure reports to the email address above.
