This is librep, an Emacs Lisp-like runtime library for UNIX. It
contains a LISP interpreter, byte-code compiler and virtual machine.
Applications may use the LISP interpreter as an extension language, or
it may be used for standalone scripts.

It is known to compile on at least Solaris/sparc and Linux/ix86; it is
released under the terms of the GNU GPL, copyright John Harper
<john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

For more details see:

	http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~john/sw/librep.html

To compile this you'll need GNU make and (currently) GCC. Basically,
just do `./configure ; make ; make install'. If you're building from
the CVS sources, execute `aclocal ; autoconf' first.


Notes
=====

If you're on a 64-bit architecture you may want to look at the
`--with-value-type' configure option. This is an implicitly signed
integer type (i.e. `int', `long', etc) that is wide enough to store an
arbitrary pointer without losing any bits.

It should be detected automatically by the configure script, but if not
there are two most likely required settings:

 1. For a machine with 64-bit pointers and longs, but only 32-bit ints
    the following could be done:

	$ ./configure --with-value-type=long

 2. For a machine with both int and long 32-bits, but with 64-bit
    pointers and long long ints, then:

	$ ./configure --with-value-type="long long"

If this option is set incorrectly (i.e. to an integer type that is too
small) a run-time assertion will be triggered when the interpreter
initialises itself.
