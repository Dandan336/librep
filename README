This is librep, an Emacs Lisp-like runtime library for UNIX. It
contains a LISP interpreter, byte-code compiler and virtual machine.
Applications may use the LISP interpreter as an extension language, or
it may be used for standalone scripts.

It is known to compile on at least Solaris/sparc and Linux/ix86; it is
released under the terms of the GNU GPL, copyright John Harper

To compile this you'll need GNU make and (currently) GCC. Basically,
just do `./configure ; make ; make install'. If you're building from
the CVS sources, execute `aclocal ; autoconf' first.

Please send any success or failure reports to the email address above.
