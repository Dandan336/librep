This directory contains four patches against gmp-2.02, they should be
applied in the following order:

	1. gmp-2.0.2-1.shared.patch
	2. gmp-2.0.2-sparc.patch
	3. gmp-2.0.2-fixes.patch
	4. gmp-2.0.2-solaris.patch

The first three are from the Redhat gmp SRPM (2.02-10), and should be
installed on all platforms. The last patch allows the patched gmp to
compile using the native Solaris assembler and linker
