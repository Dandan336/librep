	* configure.in: version 0.12

	* configure.in: check libdld for shl_load

2000-06-09  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* Makefile.in: added distclean target as alias for realclean

	* configure.in: changed --with-gmp and --with-gdbm to be more
	conventional --with-gmp-prefix and --with-gdbm-prefix

	* configure.in: when extracting dependences from C files using
	GCC, use `-MM' not `-MM -MG' (from Brad Thompson <yak@mit.edu>)

2000-06-07  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* configure.in, Makefile.in: moved DOC file to ${repexecdir}
	since GDBM databases are endian-specific

	[ this is sub-optimal, since the lisp files are shared, but
	it's okay for now .. ]

2000-05-31  Karl M. Hegbloom  <karlheg@debian.org>

	* Makefile.in (TAGS): Use --regex to grab DEFSTRING, DEFSYM,
	DEFUN, and DEFUN_INT information also.
	(TAGS tags): add lowercase target name for lazy typists.
